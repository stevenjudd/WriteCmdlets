The Write cmdlets in PowerShell allow you to control the output from your code.
However, there are multiple cmdlets that start with "Write-" and you need to

you how and when to properly use each Write cmdlet and help you understand the
reasons why you should use them. Please join us for a light-hearted journey into
using the Write cmdlets.
